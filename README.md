Some little scripts that interact with the Sony SH800S

These are currently (June 2018) very rough and a work in progress.

One just extracts all the error messages from the Sony SH800S log files.  Copy the logs to a folder and run the script there.

The other will  check that our users complete the full ceaning cycle after their sort or prior to shutdown.
